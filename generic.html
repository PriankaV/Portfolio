                        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                        <p>Hi, I am Prianka Vikram; a Junior at Georgia State University pursuing a major in Computer Science with a certificate in Data Science. My academic journey has immersed me in a diverse range of programming languages, including Java, Python, C++, C#, SQL, PL/SQL, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                        <p>Some major classes I have taken include: Data Science, Software Development, and Programming Language Concepts. Some important classes I'm currently taking are: Fundamentals of Data Science, Database Systems, and Capstone 1.</p>
                        <p>I have acquired the following certifications: "Introduction to Java" by Learn Quest and "MTA: Software Development Fundamentals." I am actively studying to gain more in the near future!</p>
                        <p>In addition to school, I have programmed several projects to showcase my skills and interest; I have also gained a ton of valuable skills though my internships.</p>
                        <p>I am active in student organizations like Game Development UNICEF, and I participate in hackathons. These activities help me stay active and connected!</p>

                        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                        <p>I’m a 21-year-old from Atlanta, GA, with a diverse range of interests that keep my life vibrant and fulfilling. A bit about me: I have two brothers—one older and one younger—and I share my home with a charming pet cat.</p>
                        <p>Gaming is a major passion of mine. I used to play Valorant, which hopefully has sharpened my strategic thinking and teamwork skills. My interest in gaming began with Minecraft, where I started coding mods to enhance my gameplay experience. This early fascination with game development has only deepened over time.</p>
                        <p>Baking is another cherished hobby. I specialize in creating pastries and other sweet treats, a passion that started as a friendly competition with my older brother. There's something incredibly rewarding about crafting delicious confections from scratch, and it’s a joy I continue to explore.</p>
                        <p>I have gotten back into painting recently. This time I am focusing on improving my technique and exploring new styles, which has been very messy but a great creative outlet.</p>
